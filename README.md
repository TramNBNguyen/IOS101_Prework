## App Brainstorming (Step 4):
1. Goodnotes:

Some idea for my app:

        Create, edit, and organize shopping lists (groceries, birthday presents, christmas,...)
        Add links to products directly within the list (like link to the website or any other sources)
        Attach photo for easy identification
    Scanning
        Scan and store expiration dates 
        Track purchase dates for reference or warranty \
    Planning
        List for party with item quantities 
        Calender 
        Share lists with others for collaboration
    recipe book
        Upload and categorize recipe
        Add tags or notes for quick retrieval
    Notification
        Reminders for expiration dates or upcoming event
